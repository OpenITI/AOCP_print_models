# AOCP Print Models

The Arabic-script OCR Catalyst Project trains models for transcribing and analyzing the layout of books printed in Arabic-scripts. Our primary focus was Arabic and Persian. You can also find models for Urdu and Ottoman Turkish. Generalized transcription models beginning with `apt` were trained on Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkish.
